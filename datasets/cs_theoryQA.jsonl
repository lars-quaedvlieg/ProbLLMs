SGD is widely used in training deep neural networks and other large-scale machine learning models.", "rejected": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning for training models. It is a variant of the gradient descent algorithm that updates the model parameters based on a single data point or a small subset of data points at a time, making it computationally efficient for large datasets. In addition, machine learning models often require extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering to improve performance."}
